This GitHub repository hosts the Java project for Oasis Infobyte's Number Guessing Game. The project offers an interactive and engaging gaming experience, allowing players to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

This Java code implements a simple "Guess the Number" game using Swing GUI components. It generates a random number within a specified range and allows the user to guess the number. After each guess, it provides feedback whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game ends when the user correctly guesses the number or exceeds the maximum number of allowed guesses.
